# HAWKCantileverController

This LabView project runs the PID controller for controlling the force applied by HAWK during mechanical stimulation of freely moving C. elegans nematodes.

The code requires LabView 2013 with the FPGA module to run. The project consists of three applications that run on the host PC, RTOS of the CompactRIO, and FPGA, respectively.
